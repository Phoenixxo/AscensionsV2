# AscensionsV2

AscensionsV2 is a modular core plugin designed to extend the functionality of [X-Prison](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/x-prison-1-8-1-20-all-in-one-prison-core.83058/) by adding an ascension-based progression system. Players can reset their rank, prestige, and balance to gain long-term benefits, visual ranks, and unlockable perks.

This plugin is designed as a foundational core that will support future gameplay enhancements, such as stat boosts, custom enchants, and cosmetic progression.
